# Feature example

A simple Feature to demonstrate the usage of orodruin.

## Requirements

Build orodruin as described [here](../README.md).

## Building and running

### 1. Install dependencies (including orodruin)

```
$ yarn install
```

### 2. Build the feature

```
$ yarn run build
```

### 3. Start the development server

Currently, something is broken and the _orodruin_ binary is not found. So you'll
have to run:

```
$ node ../dist/cli.js serve
```

In theory, it should however work like this:

```
$ yarn run serve
```

This will open the feature in your default browser.
