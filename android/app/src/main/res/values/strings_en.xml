<!--
These strings are actually not being used yet - they would need to move to
values-en, and have the 'en_' prefix removed from their name. But currently,
that would break the app, since we are currently forcing it to be in German
by not supplying English strings. So this file is merely for already putting
all the English strings under version control.
