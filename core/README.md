# The polyPod core code

This is the platform independent core logic of the polyPod - all the inner
workings such as feature runtime and data storage, as well as all APIs available
to features.

## Please note

This code used to be spread across more than a dozen individual repositories,
and it is not particularly coherent at the moment. We are working on improving
the structure and documentation, as well as implementing missing functionality -
a lot.
