# polyPod for iOS

The polyPod app for iOS devices

This code base is still in a proof of concept stage, i.e. we're trying to make a
very basic version of the polyPod app for Android work on iOS, to see where the
challenges are.

# Building

1. Run `build.js` in the parent directory.
2. Run `update-dependencies.sh`.
3. Open the _PolyPodApp_ project in XCode and build it there.
