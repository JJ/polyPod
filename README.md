# polyPod

The polyPod

## Please note

We are in the process of migrating the individual repositories that
make up the polyPod into this repository, which will contain all the
code necessary to build the polyPod for Android, the polyPod for iOS,
as well as polyPod features.

What still needs to be done:

1. We need to get all dependencies from the source tree, rather than
   GitHub Packages. We will probably need to introduce some central
   build code for this.
2. We need to migrate all GitHub actions into `/.github`.
3. We need to improve the structure of this repository and provide
   some high level instructions on how to work with the relevant parts
   in this README.
4. We need to integrate [polyPod-iOS](https://github.com/polypoly-eu/polyPod-iOS).
